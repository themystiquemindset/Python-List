# ðŸŒŸ List Operations in Python ðŸŒŸ

Welcome to the *List Operations* repository! Whether you're a beginner or an experienced Python developer, this repository offers a structured approach to mastering Python's list operations. It is divided into three levels of difficulty: *Basic, **Intermediate, and **Advanced*.

Each level will provide you with essential techniques to handle lists effectively, from simple manipulations to more complex algorithms and optimizations.

## ðŸ’¡ Introduction

Lists are one of the most versatile data structures in Python. Whether you're working with small datasets or large-scale projects, knowing how to manipulate lists efficiently is a must.

In this repository, you will:

- *Start with Basic List Operations*: Learn how to add, remove, and access list elements.
- *Move to Intermediate Operations*: Discover sorting, reversing, and filtering lists.
- *Master Advanced Operations*: Work with nested lists, optimize operations, and implement algorithms.

The goal is to empower you with the skills to work with lists at any level of complexity. Letâ€™s dive in!

## ðŸ”¹ Basic Operations

At this level, we focus on *fundamental* list manipulations. This includes:

- *Adding elements* using .append(), .insert(), or .extend().
- *Removing elements* with .remove(), .pop(), or .clear().
- *Accessing* list elements by index.
- *Looping* through lists.
- *Slicing* and extracting sublists.

### Example:
python
# Adding elements
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
my_list.append(4)  # Adds 4 to the end of the list

# Accessing elements
first_item = my_list[0]  # Accesses the first element

# Slicing a list
sub_list = my_list[1:3]  # Extracts elements from index 1 to 2


---

## ðŸ”¸ Intermediate Operations

At the intermediate level, we explore more complex operations such as:

- Sorting lists with .sort() and sorted().
- Reversing a list using .reverse().
- List Comprehension: Create lists using concise syntax.
- Filtering and Mapping lists with filter() and map().

### Example:
python
# Sorting a list
my_list = [4, 2, 3, 1]
my_list.sort()  # Sorts the list in-place

# List comprehension
squares = [x**2 for x in my_list]  # Creates a new list with squares of elements


---

## ðŸ”§ Advanced Operations

Now we tackle advanced operations that require a deeper understanding of Python and problem-solving skills:

- Working with multidimensional lists (nested lists).
- Flattening lists to a single list.
- Implementing sorting algorithms like QuickSort and MergeSort.
- Optimizing list operations for performance in large datasets.

### Example:
python
# Flattening a nested list
nested_list = [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]
flattened_list = [item for sublist in nested_list for item in sublist]

# QuickSort implementation
def quicksort(arr):
    if len(arr) <= 1:
        return arr
    pivot = arr[0]
    less = [x for x in arr[1:] if x <= pivot]
    greater = [x for x in arr[1:] if x > pivot]
    return quicksort(less) + [pivot] + quicksort(greater)
